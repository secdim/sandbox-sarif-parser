= SecDim Sandbox ðŸ’Ž

SecDim Sandbox provides *Just In Time (JIT)* secure coding training labs based on the finding reported by majority of security scanning tool. 
It can also enrich the reported findings with link to related secure coding exercises.

== Description
SecDim Sandbox command-line application provides two main functions:

* *enrich*: Parses a SARIF file, enriches each finding with links to SecDim Secure Coding  exercises, and outputs an augmented SARIF file.
* *jit*: Manages Just-In-Time training games on the SecDim platform by creating or updating a game and adding relevant challenge slugs extracted from a SARIF file.

Both features can be used manually or integrated into CI/CD pipelines.



== Installation

. Ensure you have Go (`>=1.20`) installed: https://go.dev/doc/install[Go installation docs].
. Clone this repository and navigate to the project root
. Build the binary: `make build`

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/secdim/sandbox-sarif-parser.git
cd sandbox-sarif-parser
make build
----

The compiled binary is `bin/sandbox`.

== Usage

=== Enrich SARIF
Parse and enrich a SARIF file with SecDim Secure Coding labs

`sandbox enrich --in <input.sarif> --out <output.sarif> [--tool <tool>]`

=== JIT Game Management

Extract challenge slugs from a SARIF file and either create or update a SecDim game

[source,bash]
----
sandbox jit --game-slug <slug> [--new] --in <input.sarif> 
            [--game-title <title>] 
            [--game-desc <desc>] 
            [--game-tags <t1,t2>] 
            [--game-deps <d1,d2>] 
            [--game-chals <c1, c2>]
            [--game-start <RFC3339>] [--game-end <RFC3339>]
            [--filter-by-language]
           
----

* Add `--new` to create a fresh game (requires title, description, challenges, start/end).
* Omit `--new` to patch an existing game (will error if the game does not exist).
* Add `--filter-by-language` to filter challenges based on programming languages detected from the SARIF file. If this flag is not provided, all challenges matching any detected language will be included. We recommend using this flag to ensure the training content is relevant to the codebase.


**Example with language filtering:**
[source,bash]
----
sandbox jit --game-slug python-security-training --filter-by-language --in report.sarif
----

If the SARIF file contains Python vulnerabilities, only Python-related challenges will be added to the game.

== Environment Variables
Override defaults via environment variables (flags take precedence):

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Variable | Description
|`SECDIM_API_KEY`         | API key for enrichment & game endpoints (required)
|`JIT_GAME_SLUG`        | Default game slug
|`JIT_GAME_TITLE`       | Default game title
|`JIT_GAME_DESC`        | Default game description
|`JIT_GAME_CHALS`       | Default game challenges
|`JIT_GAME_TAGS`        | Default game tags
|`JIT_GAME_DEPARTMENTS` | Default game departments
|`JIT_GAME_START_TIME`  | Default start time
|`JIT_GAME_END_TIME`    | Default end time
|===

== Examples

=== Create a new training game and populate it with challenges
[source,bash]
----
export SECDIM_API_KEY=XYZ
sandbox jit --new --game-slug just-in-time-training 
             --game-title "Just-In-Time Training" 
             --game-desc "Exercises based on reported vulnerabilities" 
             --game-tags Trivial,Easy,Medium,Hard 
             --game-start 2025-05-06T00:00:00Z 
             --game-end   2025-06-06T00:00:00Z 
             --game-chals "xsspy,xssjs"
             --in report.sarif
             --filter-by-language
----

=== Updating an existing game based on new vulnerabilities
[source,bash]
----
sandbox jit --game-slug just-in-time-training --in report.sarif --filter-by-language
----

== CI/CD Integration
In your GitHub Actions (or other CI), you can add steps like:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Build
  run: make build

- name: Enrich SARIF
  run: sandbox enrich --in report.sarif --out enriched_report.sarif

- name: Update JIT Game with Language Filtering
  run: |
    export SECDIM_API_KEY=${{ secrets.SEC_DIM_API_KEY }}
    sandbox jit --game-slug language-specific-training --filter-by-language --in report.sarif
